Data Format and Notes
The data files consist of ASCII text in lines with 33 columns of numbers.  he first column is a time stamp and is the decimal days after the first second of January 1, 2007. For example, January 1, 2007 is a fractional day (not day 1 as it would be with day-of-year). The time interval between measurements is typically 5 to 15 minutes, although it is as long as 30 minutes at some of the lower stations during the coldest months of winter (the loggers were programed to take less measurements during the depths of winter). The subsequent 32 columns in the data are the temperatures in Celcius of the thermistor locations, starting at the top of the temperature string.  The thermistors are placed with a 25cm spacing in the top 5.5m and a 50cm spacing in the lower 4.5m.  The bottom of the string is nominally at 10m below the surface, with the top at the surface.  However, as a result of the ablation and accumulation that occurs during year or multi-year emplacements, these locations are nominal.  The traverse line occupies the lower accumulation zone, so that most strings experienced between 25cm to 1m of accumulation, although at times during the peak of the melt season, 1 or more of the top thermistors were exposed to the atmosphere.

Note - T1new.txt and T1old.txt are two different thermistor strings installed at location T1. T1old was installed in 2007, and T1new was installed in 2008.
