======== Temperature data for RetMIP comparison ============

At each site, depths are given in metres below the surface and therefore account for the accumulation of new snow at the surface. Temperature are in degree Celsius. At DYE-2_long and at Summit, a firn model was run to account for the compaction occuring between the surface and each sensor and between the sensors. At the other sites, compaction is not accounted for because of the short time span (DYE-2_16 or FA) of the observations or, at KAN_U, because the firn is less subject to compaction.

Please contact the me and the datasets' owners before any use not related to RetMIP.
