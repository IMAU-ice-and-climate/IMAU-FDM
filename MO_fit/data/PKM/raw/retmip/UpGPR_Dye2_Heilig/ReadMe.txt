File description:

SurfaceHeight_m_FirnCover1d.asc

Daily surface height above the up-GPR antenna. Data from the FirnCover station located 60m away from the up-GPR. Contains time stamp in days since year zero day zero and surface height in meter.

SurfaceHeight_m_FirnCover1h.asc

Hourly surface height above the up-GPR antenna. Data from the FirnCover station located 60m away from the up-GPR. Contains time stamp in days since year zero day zero and surface height in meter.

SurfaceHeight_m_GCnet.asc

Daily surface height above the up-GPR antenna. Data from the GC-Net station located 1km away from the up-GPR. Contains time stamp in days since year zero day zero and surface height in meter. Reference to this data:

SurfaceHeight_m_URSAM_SR50.asc

Hourly surface height above the up-GPR antenna. Data from the URSAM station located few meters away from the up-GPR. Contains time stamp in days since year zero day zero and surface height in meter.

SWE_AboveAntenna_bulk2016.asc

Daily estimation of the Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) above the up-GPR antenna. Contains time stamp in days since year zero day zero and SWE in kg/m2.

PercolationDepth_m_Perco2016.asc

Hourly depth of the meltwater percolation front below the surface. The original measurement is the height of the percolation front above the antenna. It is converted to depth bellow the surface using the up-GPR-derived surface height. Contains time stamp in days since year zero day zero and percolation depth in meter.

LWC_VolFrac_AboveAntenna_lwcBulk2016.asc

Hourly volumetric average water content between the surface and the antenna. Contains time stamp in days since year zero day zero and liquid water content in volumetric fraction (unitless or m3 of water per m3).

LWC_VolFrac_L15x_lwc15x_2016.asc

Hourly volumetric average water content in the layer comprised between the reference horizon, 1.3 m above the antenna, and the 2015 end-of-summer horizon, 2.3 m above the antenna. The depths of those two horizons were assumed constant. Contains time stamp in days since year zero day zero and liquid water content in volumetric fraction (unitless or m3 of water per m3).
