These cores were collected near the western end of the EGIG line in the percolation zone of the Greenland icesheet (GrIS). We collected the cores with a 9 cm diameter Kovacs core drill with a powerhead. All measurements of mass and lithology were made in the field during drilling. The density values are calculated from measurements of core mass with the exception of the upper 98 cm of the core at H5 where density measurements were conducted in a snowpit study with a rip cutter.
Firn lithology is based on grain shape and pure ice content. The numbers for percent ice are based on a visual estimation of the volumetric percentage of ice.

Layers: ice, wetted firn, unwetted firn, faceted grains, wetted facets, dry snow, and wet snow
